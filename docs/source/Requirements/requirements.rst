Jovian requirements
========================

Jovian has fairly minimal system requirements.
Jovian is intended for use on powerful (virtual)servers and/or grid-computing configurations.
However, the pipeline will function on most PC's and laptops.

Make sure there is enough storage on your system available as Jovian depends on several databases that have to be downloaded.

Supported operating systems
============================
Jovian works exclusively on Linux. Specifically, ``RHEL 7`` (+ ``CentOS 7``) and ``Ubuntu 18.04 LTS``.

Jovian, and all its functions, also works on the Windows Subsystem for Linux with the ``Ubuntu 18.04`` distro. However, stability and functionality are currently not guaranteed on WSL.
